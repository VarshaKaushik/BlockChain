BlockChain: A blockchain is a public ledger of information collected 
through a network that sits on top of the internet. It is how this 
information is recorded that gives blockchain its groundbreaking 
potential. The technology can be used to develop blockchain 
applications, such as social networks, messengers, games, exchanges, 
storage platforms, voting systems, prediction markets, online shops and 
much more. In this sense, it is similar to the internet, which is why 
some have dubbed it “The Internet 3.0”.
